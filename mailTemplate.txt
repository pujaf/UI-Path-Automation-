Dear {0},

The International Student Organization (iSo) is honored to invite you and your family to the biggest international event of the year on OSU campus, Cultural Night 2018. The event is on March 30 & March 31 from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm at the Seretean Center for Performing Arts on the Stillwater campus of OSU. The theme of this year is Women of the World. We will showcase over 7 area clubs from different countries, each competing by presenting cultural performances from their home countries. This event will be a true manifest of the diversity at OSU.
 
We would love to have you and your family as our esteemed guests for this event by providing you with 3 complementary tickets. Please take a moment to RSVP to this e-mail by March 28th with the number of your guests and for which day will you like to have the tickets (Mar 30/ Mar 31), so that we may reserve them for you.
We look forward to seeing you for this event and please do not hesitate to contact us for any questions at iso@okstate.edu.
