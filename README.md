# UI-Path-Automation-
This project was developed as a voluntary help to send a mass mail inviting VIPs for Cultural Night Event. The project is automated in UI Path. An excel sheet with name and email of the invitees are passed to the project. The bot reads the name and make changes on the template attached for email body, attaches an image file and send email to the corresponding email.
